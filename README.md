## Background/Overview
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results
* You can see an overview of the statistics from the data below.

  * The mean temperature in June (75F) is only 4 degrees higher than the mean temperature in December (71F)
  * The standard deviations between the data sets is relatively the same. Dec = 3.7F and June = 3.3F
  * While the mean temperature is only 4 degrees lower in December, the minimum temperature is 8 degrees colder in December (December min=56F vs June min=64F).

## Summary
* The purpose of this project is to propose a business plan to investors in opening a surf and shake shop in Hawaii. We performed weather analysis on Hawaii's weather as the weather can effect the success of our surf shop. We calculated that the average temperatures and precipitation readings show that there will be many warm days for people to surf and enjoy ice cream from our surf shop. The precipitation for the months of June and December are from past years, therefore we can predict that there will be less rainy days to prevent people from going to the beach to surf.
